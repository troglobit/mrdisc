`mrdisc(8)` is a UNIX compatible implementation of [RFC4286][], the
Multicast Router Discovery Protocol.  It is intended to be a way of
informing IGMP/MLD snoopers on a LAN of multicast capable routers.

    Usage: mrdisc IFNAME [IFNAME ...]

When complete, `mrdisc(8)` will be integrated in the SMCRoute, mrouted,
and pimd multicast routing daemons.  In fairness, both the Linux and
*BSD kernels should probably implement this instead.  When a multicast
routing daemon opens a routing socket and declares a set of VIFs, the
kernel knows which interfaces to send IGMP/MLD discovery frames on.

Also, both Linux and the *BSD kernels have bridges with built-in IGMP
and MLD snooping support that would greatly benefit from dynamically
learning multicast router ports.
